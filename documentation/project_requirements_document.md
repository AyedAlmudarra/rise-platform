# RISE Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

RISE is an AI-powered data analytics platform designed specifically for startups, investors, and executives in the Saudi market. The platform converts raw business data into actionable insights, allowing users to monitor performance metrics, identify growth obstacles, and prepare investor-ready reports. By providing comprehensive dashboards and AI-driven recommendations, RISE empowers startups to better understand their performance, helps investors make informed decisions, and supports executives with detailed operational and financial overviews.

The project is being built to address the need for data-driven decision making in an ecosystem where startups and investors require real-time, predictive insights to thrive. Key objectives include delivering dynamic, real-time dashboards, facilitating a precise investor matching process, and ensuring secure data handling in compliance with local privacy laws such as Saudi Arabia’s PDPL. Success will be measured by user engagement, the accuracy of AI-generated insights, and the seamless integration of multiple data import/export sources and third-party tools.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Development of a web-only platform with mobile responsiveness.
*   User registration and login flow with OAuth integration (Google and LinkedIn).
*   Dedicated user flows for Startups, Investors, and Administrators that include role-based dashboards.
*   Real-time dashboards displaying key performance indicators like MRR and CAC.
*   AI-driven predictive insights, automated financial reporting, and strategic recommendations.
*   Investor matching algorithm that considers multiple data points (industry, revenue model, growth stage, etc.).
*   Data import capability for CSV, Excel, and PDF files with possible integration with accounting and CRM tools.
*   Third-party integrations for collaboration (Slack), payment processing (Stripe), CRM (Salesforce), and marketing (Mailchimp, HubSpot).
*   Integration of Supabase for database management, user authentication (Supabase Auth and Clerk Auth), and file storage.
*   Implementation of strong security measures including encryption for data at rest and in transit, regular security audits and compliance with PDPL.
*   Clear user interface design that uses the gradient color scheme (#00002e, #00bfe6, #b04af6) and Frutiger LT Arabic (with light, roman, bold, and black weights) adapted for both English and Arabic.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Native mobile applications (initial launch is web-only with mobile responsiveness).
*   Enhancements beyond the MVP such as advanced reporting beyond immediate financial analytics and trend predictions.
*   Additional international compliance standards beyond PDPL and GDPR.
*   Custom integrations with less common third-party services not listed in the initial set.
*   Complex multi-language support outside of English and Arabic.
*   Extensive customizations for non-primary user roles beyond startups, investors, and a single admin role.

## 3. User Flow

A typical user journey starts at the landing page, where visitors are welcomed with an engaging overview of RISE. Here, they can view public profiles of startups and investors, along with key platform metrics and value propositions displayed using the platform’s signature gradient colors and typography. The landing page provides an option to sign up or log in via traditional fields or using OAuth options like Google and LinkedIn for a quick, hassle-free registration. After registration, users choose their role—startup, investor, or admin—and are seamlessly guided through an onboarding process that highlights platform capabilities tailored to their role.

Once onboarded, startups are directed to interactive dashboards featuring real-time performance metrics (such as MRR and CAC) along with modules for importing raw business data, generating financial reports, and receiving AI-driven recommendations. Investors encounter a customized dashboard that offers startup discovery, detailed due diligence reports, risk analysis, and portfolio tracking. Administrators have access to a dedicated management interface that offers oversight across the platform’s user activities, ensuring data integrity and enhanced security. Throughout this journey, role-based access ensures that every user sees only the information and tools pertinent to their needs and subscription tier.

    *   Users across different roles (startup, investor, admin) expect seamless navigation and role-based content delivery.
    *   Subscriber tiers will necessitate the implementation of role-based access control and flexible account management for plan upgrades or downgrades.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Integration Complexities:**

    *   Managing multiple third-party integrations (OAuth, Slack, Stripe, Salesforce, Mailchimp, HubSpot) might require contingency planning for API rate limits or downtimes.
    *   Data import from diverse file formats (CSV, Excel, PDF) may encounter parsing issues; building robust error handling and feedback mechanisms is critical.

*   **Scalability Concerns:**

    *   As the user base grows, ensuring real-time data processing remains efficient will be a challenge; load testing and auto-scaling measures should be considered early.

*   **Data Privacy and Compliance:**

    *   Handling financial and sensitive business data requires strict compliance with PDPL and possibly GDPR; ensuring up-to-date security practices is paramount to avoid regulatory issues.

*   **AI Model Maintenance:**

    *   Ongoing monthly training of AI models may pose challenges in maintaining model accuracy and relevance as new data comes in; regularly scheduled updates and performance monitoring must be in place.

*   **User Role Management:**

    *   Implementing robust role-based access control is vital. Mistakes in managing admin vs. regular user access could lead to data breaches or misuse.
