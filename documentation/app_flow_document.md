# RISE App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new visitor arrives at RISE, they are first greeted by an engaging landing page that displays public information about startups and investor profiles. The landing page uses the platform’s signature gradient colors and specified typography to create an inviting and accessible interface for both English and Arabic speakers. From this page, users are immediately introduced to the value proposition of receiving actionable insights. They have the option to register using either traditional email-based sign-up or by leveraging OAuth registration through Google and LinkedIn. Once a user selects their preferred method, the sign-up process guides them through creating their account with clear instructions on entering their details. If the user is returning, a simple and straightforward sign-in flow is available. For users who have forgotten their password, an easy password recovery procedure is in place. In addition to this, every user selects their role during the registration process, choosing between a startup, investor, or administrator account. This process is designed to maintain clarity, ensure security with Supabase Auth and Clerk Auth, and provide immediate access to the platform’s features based on the selected role.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon successful registration and login, users are directed to a personalized main dashboard that is tailored to their role. For startups, the dashboard displays real-time analytics including key performance indicators such as Monthly Recurring Revenue and Customer Acquisition Cost, along with intuitive visualizations that make complex data easy to understand. Investors are presented with a dashboard that highlights relevant startup performance statistics, due diligence reports, and risk analysis charts. Administrators see an organized overview of platform activities, which helps them monitor user interactions and ensure data integrity. The dashboard is built with an intuitive navigation system comprising a sidebar, headers, and well-placed widgets so that users quickly understand where to go next. The design emphasizes mobile responsiveness and clear separation of sections, ensuring that users can seamlessly move to various modules within the platform.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

In the startup mode, users can easily transition from the dashboard to detailed pages where they can import raw business data files such as CSV, Excel, and PDF. Once a file is uploaded, the platform processes the data in real time using advanced machine learning models which incorporate OpenAI fine-tuning techniques. The imported data feeds into financial report modules and AI-driven recommendation pages. The startup experience includes a dedicated section for market insights where users can access competitive benchmarks and receive strategic advice. Transitioning between these pages is smooth, with clearly visible navigation elements and interactive prompts that educate users on where to find advanced analytics and reporting tools.

For investor users, the journey begins at a specially tailored investor dashboard which provides a comprehensive overview of startups. From here, investors can dive into the startup discovery page that uses AI-driven matching algorithms. The algorithm compares factors such as industry focus, revenue model, and growth stage to provide a list of startups that align with the investor’s criteria. Investors can then move to detailed due diligence reports that include risk analysis and portfolio tracking. Navigation between these features is designed to be straightforward, with each page linked contextually so that investors always know how to return to the main dashboard. There are also advanced reporting pages that help investors track historic data alongside predictive trends, ensuring they can make well-informed decisions. Administrators, on the other hand, have a separate flow where they can access a control panel that oversees both startup and investor activities. Their pages allow them to monitor the entire platform, manage user concerns, and perform regular audits to maintain data integrity and security. Every transition between pages is designed to be fluid and intuitive, providing guidance through clear calls to action and visible breadcrumbs when needed.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can easily access their account settings from any page by clicking on a dedicated settings icon or link usually found in the header. In these settings pages, users have the ability to update personal information, change account preferences, and configure notifications according to their needs. For those with subscription-based accounts, there are clear and secure pages dedicated to managing billing information and subscription tiers, allowing decisions on plan transitions to be made without any interruption to their workflow. Once changes are saved, users are seamlessly returned to the main app flow, ensuring that their day-to-day operations remain uninterrupted. The design emphasizes simplicity and user empowerment, ensuring that account modifications are handled in a secure and straightforward manner.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

When an unexpected event occurs, such as a file failing to import due to an unsupported format or invalid data entries, the system provides clear and descriptive error messages that help users understand the issue and guide them on how to proceed. In case of connectivity problems or server downtime, the interface gracefully shifts to an offline mode or displays fallback messages that maintain consistency in design. In any situation where a user attempts an action they do not have permissions for, the system immediately informs them with a friendly message and redirects them to a safe page where they can continue with allowed operations. These error states are carefully crafted to ensure that users universally feel supported and are never left stranded during their journey, maintaining an overall smooth and coherent experience across the platform.
