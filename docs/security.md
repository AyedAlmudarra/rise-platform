# RISE Platform Security Guide

This document outlines the security practices and configurations implemented in the RISE platform to ensure data protection, user privacy, and compliance with Saudi regulations.

## Data Security

### Encryption

- **Data at Rest**: All data stored in Supabase is encrypted at rest.
- **Data in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS is used for all communications between the client and server.
- **API Keys**: All API keys and secrets are stored in environment variables, never in the codebase.

### Authentication

- **User Authentication**: Managed through Supabase Auth with secure password hashing.
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with proper expiration and rotation policies.
- **Password Policies**: Enforced minimum strength requirements and breached password detection.

### Authorization

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Implemented in Supabase for all tables to ensure users only access their authorized data.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for startups, investors, and administrators.
- **API Access Control**: Endpoints protected with proper authentication checks.

## Compliance with Saudi Regulations

### PDPL (Personal Data Protection Law)

- **Data Minimization**: Only collecting necessary personal information.
- **User Consent**: Clear mechanisms for obtaining and recording user consent.
- **Data Retention**: Policies for proper retention and deletion of user data.
- **Data Subject Rights**: Mechanisms for users to access, correct, and delete their personal data.

### NCA (National Cybersecurity Authority) Compliance

- **ECC-1:2018 Controls**: Implementation of essential cybersecurity controls.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Procedures for handling security incidents.
- **Regular Security Testing**: Schedule for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.

## Security Best Practices

### Code Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Implementation of TypeScript for type safety.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated server-side.
- **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding to prevent XSS attacks.

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DDoS attacks.
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper configuration to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.
- **OpenAI API Security**: Secure handling of AI model interactions with proper error handling.

### Infrastructure Security

- **Vercel/Server Hardening**: Deployment platform configured according to security best practices.
- **Database Security**: Supabase configured with proper network policies and access controls.
- **Regular Backups**: Automated backup procedures to prevent data loss.

## Security Monitoring and Response

### Monitoring

- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events.
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for suspicious activities or potential breaches.
- **Regular Audits**: Schedule for security control reviews and audits.

### Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Processes for identifying potential security incidents.
2. **Containment**: Procedures to limit the impact of a confirmed incident.
3. **Eradication**: Removing the cause of the incident.
4. **Recovery**: Restoring systems to normal operation.
5. **Lessons Learned**: Process for improving security based on incidents.

## Security Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all sensitive configuration values are stored as environment variables.
2. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Configure the server to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
3. **Security Headers**: Implement security headers:
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   X-Frame-Options: DENY
   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
   ```
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies and the platform itself up to date.
5. **Access Control**: Limit administrative access to the production environment.
