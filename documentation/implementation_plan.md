# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Clone the CodeGuide Starter Pro repository from the provided link (<https://github.com/codeGuide-dev/codeguide-starter-pro>) and create a new GitHub repository from it. (Project Requirements Document)
2.  Create a new local directory structure as per the starter kit’s guidelines. (Project Requirements Document)
3.  Install Node.js v20.2.1 if not already installed. Run `node -v` to verify the installation. (Tech Stack Document)
4.  Install the package manager (npm or Yarn) and confirm its installation. (Tech Stack Document)

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Initialize the Next.js project using Next.js 14 (note: Next.js 14 is explicitly required for compatibility with current AI coding tools and LLM models). (Tech Stack Document)

2.  Set up Tailwind CSS configuration by creating and configuring `tailwind.config.js` in the project root. (Tech Stack Document)

3.  Configure TypeScript by setting up `tsconfig.json` as per the starter kit guidelines. (Project Requirements Document)

4.  Integrate Shadcn UI components for a consistent design by installing the required packages and adding any necessary configuration files. (Project Requirements Document)

5.  Create a global styles file at `/styles/globals.css` and update it to include the gradient (#00002e, #00bfe6, #b04af6) and the Frutiger LT Arabic font for both English and Arabic. (Design & Branding Guidelines)

6.  Add internationalization (i18n) support in `next.config.js` to allow English and Arabic language options. (Project Requirements Document)

7.  Create the landing page at `/pages/index.tsx` to present public information for startups and investors. (Project Requirements Document)

8.  Develop the registration page at `/pages/register.tsx` including role selection (startup, investor, admin) and incorporating both email registration and OAuth options. (Project Requirements Document)

9.  Create the login page at `/pages/login.tsx` with OAuth support for Google and LinkedIn, using Clerk Auth integration. (Project Requirements Document)

10. Build dashboard pages for each user role:

    *   Startup dashboard at `/pages/dashboard/startup.tsx` (real-time KPIs, financial reports, market analysis, AI-driven recommendations)
    *   Investor dashboard at `/pages/dashboard/investor.tsx` (startup discovery, due diligence, risk analysis, portfolio tracking)
    *   Admin dashboard at `/pages/dashboard/admin.tsx` (platform oversight, user management, data integrity monitoring) (Project Requirements Document)

11. **Validation**: Run `npm run dev` and open the application in a browser to verify that the landing, registration, login, and dashboard pages render correctly.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Set up the Supabase project and configure it for database, authentication, and storage. (Tech Stack Document)
2.  Create SQL scripts or use Supabase’s interface to define database tables for users, dashboards, analytics, and other key entities. (Project Requirements Document)
3.  In the `/backend` directory, create an API endpoint for user registration in `/backend/api/register.ts` to handle new user sign-ups. (Project Requirements Document)
4.  Develop an API endpoint for user login in `/backend/api/login.ts` that integrates with both Supabase Auth and Clerk Auth. (Project Requirements Document)
5.  Create an authentication service in `/backend/services/auth.ts` to wrap calls to Clerk Auth for proper token management. (Project Requirements Document)
6.  Implement a data encryption module in `/backend/config/encryption.js` to secure sensitive data per PDPL and GDPR requirements. (Project Requirements Document)
7.  Build an API endpoint for file imports in `/backend/api/import.ts` supporting CSV, Excel, and PDF formats with robust error handling. (Project Requirements Document)
8.  Set up separate integration endpoints in `/backend/api/integrations/` for third-party tools (accounting software, Slack, Stripe, Salesforce, Mailchimp, HubSpot). (Project Requirements Document)
9.  Develop the investor matching algorithm as an API endpoint in `/backend/api/investor-matching.ts` to pair startups and investors based on industry, stage, and other criteria. (Project Requirements Document)
10. Implement an AI analytics endpoint in `/backend/api/analytics.ts` that uses OpenAI (with fine-tuning and RAG capabilities) to generate predictive models and insights updated monthly. (Project Requirements Document)
11. **Validation**: Use Postman (or similar tool) to test the registration, login, import, investor matching, and analytics endpoints ensuring all return expected responses.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  Update the frontend authentication pages (login and registration) to call the respective backend API endpoints (`/backend/api/register.ts` and `/backend/api/login.ts`) using axios or fetch. (App Flow Document)
2.  Connect the landing and dashboard pages with backend API endpoints to fetch real-time user data and analytics. (App Flow Document)
3.  Integrate file upload components on the frontend that communicate with `/backend/api/import.ts` for CSV, Excel, and PDF imports. (Project Requirements Document)
4.  Link the startup dashboard’s UI components to the analytics API (`/backend/api/analytics.ts`) to display KPIs, financial reports, and AI-driven recommendations. (Project Requirements Document)
5.  Connect the investor dashboard with the investor matching API (`/backend/api/investor-matching.ts`) so investors can discover and review startups. (Project Requirements Document)
6.  **Validation**: Run integration tests by registering a new user, logging in, uploading a sample file, and verifying that the correct data is displayed on the dashboards.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Configure environment variables locally for Supabase credentials, Clerk keys, and OpenAI API keys, and then add them to the deployment settings. (Project Requirements Document)
2.  Set up a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions to run tests, build the project, and deploy changes automatically. (Tech Stack Document)
3.  Configure Vercel for the frontend deployment of the Next.js project, ensuring to use Next.js 14 as installed earlier. (Tech Stack Document)
4.  Deploy the backend services to Supabase Functions (or as serverless functions on Vercel if preferred) ensuring secure endpoints. (Tech Stack Document)
5.  Ensure HTTPS is enforced and any necessary domain configurations (e.g., custom domains) are completed in Vercel and/or Supabase settings. (Project Requirements Document)
6.  **Validation**: Deploy a staging version of the app and perform end-to-end tests with Cypress to ensure that both frontend and backend services are functioning as expected.

## Additional Steps: AI Training and Security

1.  Set up a scheduled job in the CI/CD pipeline to trigger monthly training runs for the AI model by calling a retraining script located at `/backend/ai/retrain.ts`. (Project Requirements Document)
2.  **Validation**: Check logs and model output after a test trigger to ensure that retraining is scheduled and executed correctly.
3.  Implement logging and error handling middleware in `/backend/middleware/errorHandler.ts` to capture runtime errors and log them appropriately. (Project Requirements Document)
4.  Configure security policies and access controls in `/backend/config/security.ts` to enforce PDPL and GDPR compliance, including data encryption and user access management. (Project Requirements Document)
5.  **Validation**: Run automated tests to simulate error scenarios (such as a malformed CSV upload) and verify that error messages are handled and logged as expected.

## Additional Steps: Design & Third-Party Integrations

1.  Finalize the design by validating that all UI components (using Shadcn UI) reflect the correct gradient colors and Frutiger LT Arabic font, both for English and Arabic texts. (Design & Branding Guidelines)
2.  **Validation**: Manually inspect the UI across different devices to ensure consistent styling and responsiveness.
3.  Integrate third-party payment and communication modules (Stripe, Mailchimp, HubSpot, Slack, Salesforce) by creating integration modules in `/backend/api/integrations/`. (Project Requirements Document)
4.  **Validation**: Test each integration in a sandbox environment to verify connectivity and data exchange.
5.  Set up monitoring and logging using Supabase logging and an external service (e.g., Sentry) for real-time error tracking. (Project Requirements Document)
6.  **Validation**: Simulate errors and monitor logs to ensure that alerts are triggered and logs capture the correct events.
7.  Perform a final end-to-end test (using Cypress) on the production deployment to validate the entire system from user registration through dashboard analytics and third-party integrations. (Q&A: Pre-Launch Checklist)
