# Backend Structure Document

This document outlines the backend architecture, database management, API design, hosting solutions, infrastructure components, and security measures for the RISE project. RISE is an AI-powered data analytics platform designed for startups, investors, and executives in the Saudi market. Its primary goal is to transform raw business data into actionable insights. Below is a detailed examination of the backend setup, explained in everyday language.

## 1. Backend Architecture

The backend is designed with simplicity, performance, and scalability in mind. The structure is built around modern, cloud-native practices while using components that are easy to manage and maintain. Here's a look at the key ideas in the architecture:

*   **Core Frameworks & Services:**

    *   **Supabase** is used for the primary database, authentication, and storage needs. It offers a managed PostgreSQL database and an API layer, making it easy to store, retrieve, and secure data.
    *   **Clerk Auth** handles user authentication and session management, supporting OAuth integrations with providers like Google and LinkedIn.

*   **Design Patterns:**

    *   The backend follows a modular design, separating different features into their own services or modules (e.g., user management, data processing, API endpoints). This ensures each component can scale independently as load increases.
    *   Clear separation of concerns is maintained, which keeps the codebase neat and makes it easy to add or update features (like AI models or investor matching algorithms) without disrupting other parts.

*   **Scalability & Performance:**

    *   Supabase's scalable database infrastructure allows the platform to handle increasing volumes of data and concurrent user requests.
    *   The use of cloud-hosted services ensures that as more startups, investors, and executives come online, performance remains consistent and responsive.

## 2. Database Management

The RISE platform relies on robust database management practices to ensure data is secure, reliable, and easily accessible. Key points include:

*   **Technology:**

    *   **Supabase Database (PostgreSQL):** The primary database solution is PostgreSQL provided by Supabase. This ensures data consistency, transactions, and the relational data integrity needed for managing user roles, business metrics, and analytics.

*   **Data Handling:**

    *   **Structured Data:** The financial data, user profiles, and analytics metrics are stored in well-defined tables.
    *   **Data Imports:** Automatic imports from CSV, Excel, and PDF files are processed and stored in the database, with temporary staging areas for data cleansing.

*   **Data Management Practices:**

    *   **Encryption:** Data is encrypted both at rest (while stored on disk) and in transit (during API calls), ensuring data security and compliance with PDPL and GDPR.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Frequent security audits are conducted to maintain data integrity and secure permissions using role-based access control.

## 3. Database Schema

The following explains the schema in a human-readable format. For clarity, an SQL example using PostgreSQL is provided.

*   **Users Table:** Stores details about users including basic information, roles (Startup, Investor, Administrator), and authentication information.
*   **Startups Table:** Contains data specific to startups such as business metrics (MRR, CAC), growth stage, and industry.
*   **Investors Table:** Contains details on investors including investment preferences, industry interests, and historical investment data.
*   **Data Imports Table:** Logs imports from external files, detailing source type (CSV, Excel, PDF), and import status.
*   **Analytics Table:** Stores real-time metrics for dashboards, including key performance indicators like MRR.
*   **Integration Logging Table:** Records interactions with third-party services (Slack, Stripe, Salesforce, Mailchimp, HubSpot, etc.)

SQL Example for a Part of the Schema (PostgreSQL):

-- Users Table CREATE TABLE users ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- Roles: 'Startup', 'Investor', 'Administrator' created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Startups Table CREATE TABLE startups ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), business_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, industry VARCHAR(100), mrr NUMERIC, cac NUMERIC, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Investors Table CREATE TABLE investors ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), investment_history TEXT, preferences JSONB, -- Example storage for preferences like deal size, risk tolerance created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

## -- Data Imports Table CREATE TABLE data_imports ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), source_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'CSV', 'Excel', or 'PDF' status VARCHAR(50), -- 'Pending', 'Processed', 'Failed' created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

The APIs have been designed following RESTful principles to ease communication between the frontend and backend. Key details include:

*   **API Approach:**

    *   RESTful API endpoints are exposed over HTTPS.
    *   Each endpoint performs a specific function (like user authentication, data import, analytics retrieval).

*   **Key Endpoints:**

    *   **/api/auth:** Manages user login, registration, and OAuth callbacks using Clerk Auth.
    *   **/api/users:** Handles CRUD operations for user profiles, including role assignments.
    *   **/api/startups:** Allows startups to submit or update their business data and retrieve analytics.
    *   **/api/investors:** Manages investor profiles, preferences, and matching criteria.
    *   **/api/imports:** Processes data file uploads, then verifies and logs the status of each import.
    *   **/api/analytics:** Provides real-time data for dashboards including key metrics like MRR and CAC.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

The chosen hosting environment supports our need for a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective backend. The key aspects of our hosting solution are:

*   **Cloud-Based Hosting:**

    *   **Supabase's Cloud Infrastructure:** Provides managed PostgreSQL hosting, authentication services, and storage. This minimizes server management overhead and ensures high availability.
